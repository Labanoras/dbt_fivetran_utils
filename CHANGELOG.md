# dbt_fivetran_utils v0.2.9

## Under the Hood
- Added a specific Snowflake macro designation for the `json_extract_path` macro. ([#50](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_fivetran_utils/pull/50))
    - This Snowflake version of the macro includes a `try_parse_json` function within the `json_extract_path` function. This allows for the macro to succeed if not all fields are a json object that are being passed through. If a field is not a json object, then a `null` record is generated. 
- Updated the Redshift macro designation for the `json_extract_path` macro. ([#50](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_fivetran_utils/pull/50))
    - Similar to the above, Redshift cannot parse the field if every record is not a json object. This update converts a non-json field to `null` so the function does not fail.
